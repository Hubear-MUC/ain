ain() 1.0
---------

A function to read in a character.

The previously used input functions just were able to read in numbers, however there was no way to enter strings to a program yet.

The usage is as following:

  char v;
  
  v = ain();
  
ain()  shows a prompt  (>)  on the screen and the entered letter will be in the variable v after the running of ain().
